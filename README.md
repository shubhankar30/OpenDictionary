# OpenDictionary
This is an application for a simplistic on-the-go dictionary. Primarily made this for learning Android application development. Feel free to contribute if you wish to!

**Purpose:**
I made this application out of need because I needed something like this. To quickly add words and check them later without too much effort. Other applications have a cluttered interface where I have to bookmark words or star them in order to store them which is unnecessary. I have to read the meaning again for the next few days to remember it. So, instead of just looking at it once, I needed to store them locally.

**Functioning:**
Just add the words you want to save in your own dictionary and view them later at any time you want.
How to use instructions are given inside the application. 

**Development Tools and technologies:**<br>
- Android Studio for development of application.<br>
- Volley API for making REST calls.<br>
- SQLite for creating Local Database.<br>
- Owlbot(www.owlbot.info) is an open source online dictionary API. 

**Future updates include:**
1. Showing the list of meaning on the homepage when you enter word for immediate use.
2. Extending the app to Oxford Dictionary APIs to get better results.
3. Adding search Feature to ListAdapter
